# Maintenance · React Native · Expo

Assets, work orders, schedules and field operations. Native iOS/Android application using React Native and Expo.

This is a presentation skeleton. Product workflows, identity integration and reviewed API adapters must be implemented and verified before production use. Module plans describe intended behavior; they are not installed or published packages.

Based on [project-boilerplate-mobile-react](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-boilerplate-mobile-react) at `92043c80ff898e28b35ba56c566dde6d06269895`.

## Start locally

Clone this repository, enter its directory and use the declared toolchain and committed lockfiles:

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Use Node from `.node-version`. Expo manages native generation from `app.json`; use SDK-compatible `npx expo install` for dependencies. Change app identifiers and configure credentials before `npx eas-cli@latest build --profile production --platform all`. No signing or store submission is performed by this starter. Test permissions, deep links, resume, offline drafts and logout on iOS and Android devices before release.

## Verify and extend

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run export
```

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [integration responsibilities](docs/INTEGRATION.md), the [presentation runbook](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/guides/presentation/REACT-NATIVE.md) and the [product scope](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/maintenance/README.md). Enable one vertical journey at a time against reviewed contracts. Verify allowed, denied, wrong-tenant, expired-session, validation and concurrency outcomes when implementing protected behavior. A pending operation is not a completed business transition.
